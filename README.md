# Calculator

The project was developed to help consolidate my programming techniques. The application was made to run on the web and was therefore developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the main focus being to consolidate the JavaScript language.

HTML

The HTML part was created from div containers, one that displays the title of the application, one that represents the display where values are shown and the container that is responsible for the keys that are respectively buttons.

CSS 

The CSS itself was intended to align the HTML tags to form a calculator layout. Its style is nothing innovative, but it has a design that applies some colors to the keys that have functionalities.

JS

This part of the development was finally my focus, I was able to fix my DOM learning, map() method to manipulate array, events, creation of arrays with spread operator. Basically, the calculator was built around 3 functionalities: number keys, operation keys and clearing the display.
